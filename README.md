# ERTorrentFixer
A very simple program that fixes the Torrent horse mods from crashing

Starting from Elden Ring update 1.09, a weird issue has occured where some Torrent mods have been crashing the game. We haven't identified exactly what the issue is, but it is related to how the FLVER files are saved. This program simply opens your Torrent c8000 file, and resaves the FLVER again. It is a very specific and temporary tool to be used to fix mods until it is implemented in other tools.

**USAGE:**

**Simply drag-and-drop your c8000.chrbnd.dcx file into the program, and it should do the trick.**
